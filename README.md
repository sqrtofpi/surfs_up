# Surfs Up with SQLite
Module 9: Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Project Overview

A key investor, W. Avy, is interested in building a surf and ice cream shop named "Waves and Ice Cream" on the island of Oahu, Hawaii initially but could potentially expand to other islands if the shop does well. W. Avy has expressed concern about the amount of precipitation on Oahu as there needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not too much that would impact ideal surfing and ice cream weather. We will be helping W. Avy with the analysis utilizing data from multiple weather stations along with SQLAlchemy to query the data stored in an SQLite database to provide him the results of our analysis along with any recommendations we think are useful for him to understand while making the decision to invest or not. This code will ultimately be used incorporated to a "Flask App", allowing W. Avy to access the data from the web browser of his choice to showcase the results to the investors board of directors.
